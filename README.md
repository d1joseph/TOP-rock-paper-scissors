# TOP-rock-paper-scissors
I made a small rock paper scissors brower game for The Odin Project foundation assignment:
* Assignment overview - https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors
* Design with Figma - https://www.figma.com/file/b5YrC0g9g8J1tZby6QgoyQ/huysRPS?node-id=0%3A1
* This project uses plain old HTML, SCSS and JS, simples :)

Feel free to clone and extend!

### To do:
1. Add accounts, sign ups and logins
2. Sharing
3. Multiplayer mode
4. Public leaderboard
5. Replace svg rock, paper and scissor imgs with 3d objects...maybe using threejs
